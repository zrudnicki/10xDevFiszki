# Version Control Guidelines

- Use Git for version control. All changes should be committed with clear, descriptive messages.
- Exclude build artifacts and sensitive files using [.gitignore](mdc:.gitignore).
- Review diffs before committing, especially for AI-generated changes.
- Use branches for new features or bug fixes, and merge via pull requests.
- Document major changes in [CHANGELOG.md](mdc:CHANGELOG.md) if present.
