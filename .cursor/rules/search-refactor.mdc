# Search and Refactor

- Use semantic search to find code by meaning, not just by text.
- Use "Find All References" to locate all usages of a function or variable.
- Use refactor tools (rename, extract, etc.) to safely update codebase-wide.
- After refactoring, run all tests in [tests/](mdc:tests) to ensure nothing is broken.
- Document significant refactors in [CHANGELOG.md](mdc:CHANGELOG.md) if present.
