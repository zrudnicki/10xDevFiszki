# Workspace Generation

- The workspace should be organized by feature or domain, with source code in the `src/` directory and tests in the `tests/` directory.
- Use a [README.md](mdc:README.md) to document the project structure and setup instructions.
- Exclude unnecessary files from version control using [.gitignore](mdc:.gitignore).
- Configuration files such as [config.js](mdc:config.js) or [settings.py](mdc:settings.py) should be placed at the root or in a `config/` directory.
