# Testing and Debugging

- Place all test files in the `tests/` directory, mirroring the structure of `src/`.
- Use a test runner such as Jest, Mocha, or Pytest, as specified in [package.json](mdc:package.json) or [requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt).
- Run tests using the appropriate command, e.g., `npm test` or `pytest`.
- Use breakpoints and the integrated debugger for step-by-step code execution.
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes before merging code.
