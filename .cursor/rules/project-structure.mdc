# Project Structure Guide

The main entry point of the project is likely located in a file such as [index.js](mdc:index.js), depending on your stack. Configuration files are typically found in [config.js](mdc:config.js). Source code is organized by feature or domain within the `src/` directory, and tests are located in the `tests/` directory.

Refer to the README for more details on project organization.
