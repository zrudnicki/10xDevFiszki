# Security Guidelines

- Never commit sensitive credentials, secrets, or API keys to the repository.
- Use environment variables for configuration secrets. Reference them in code, e.g., `process.env.SECRET_KEY` in [config.js](mdc:config.js).
- Review all AI-generated code for potential security vulnerabilities before merging.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Check [package.json](mdc:package.json) for dependencies.
- Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to scan for vulnerabilities.
