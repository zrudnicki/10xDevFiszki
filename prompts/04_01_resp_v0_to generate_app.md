Thought for 5 seconds
AI Flash Card Generator PoC
I'll create a proof of concept for an AI-powered flash card generator that lets users create study cards on any topic.

How It Works
This AI Flash Card Generator proof of concept allows users to:

Enter a topic they want to study
Choose the number of cards to generate (3, 5, or 10)
Add additional context (optional) to focus the AI on specific aspects
Generate flash cards with questions and answers using AI
Navigate through the cards with previous/next buttons
Flip cards to see answers and questions
The application uses the AI SDK to connect to OpenAI's GPT model, which generates appropriate question-answer pairs based on the user's input. The cards are displayed in an interactive deck with a flip animation.

Technical Implementation
Next.js App Router for the application structure
AI SDK for OpenAI integration
Server Actions to handle the AI generation process
Tailwind CSS for styling with custom utilities for 3D card flipping
shadcn/ui components for the UI elements
Next Steps
To turn this proof of concept into a production-ready application, you could:

Add user authentication to save card sets
Implement categories and tagging for organizing cards
Add export functionality (PDF, CSV)
Implement spaced repetition algorithms for better learning
Add image generation for visual flash cards

What I've Added
I've enhanced the AI Flash Card Generator with user authentication and spaced repetition learning:

1. User Authentication
Added Supabase authentication with sign-up and sign-in functionality
Created user profiles to save personal card sets
Implemented protected routes for authenticated users
Added a dashboard to manage saved card sets
2. Spaced Repetition Algorithm
Implemented the SuperMemo-2 (SM-2) algorithm for optimal learning
Cards are scheduled for review based on how well you know them
Rating system (1-5) to indicate knowledge level after each review
Due dates are calculated automatically based on performance
3. Database Structure
Created tables for user profiles, card sets, flash cards, and study data
Implemented row-level security for data protection
Added spaced repetition tracking for each card
Created study session tracking to monitor progress
4. Study Features
Two study modes: regular study and spaced repetition review
Card flipping interface with question/answer sides
Progress tracking during study sessions
Detailed card set view with due card indicators
How Spaced Repetition Works
The system uses an evidence-based approach to help you learn more efficiently:

After reviewing a card, you rate how well you knew the answer (1-5)
Cards you know well are scheduled further in the future
Cards you struggle with are shown more frequently
The algorithm adapts to your learning pace over time
This approach ensures you spend more time on difficult material and less time reviewing what you already know well.

======Here's a comprehensive README.md file for your AI Flash Card Generator project:

```typescriptreact project="flashcard-generator"
...
```

I've created a comprehensive README.md file for your AI Flash Card Generator project. This documentation:

1. **Introduces the project** with a clear description and feature list
2. **Details the technology stack** used in the application
3. **Provides complete setup instructions** including:

1. Installation steps
2. Environment variable configuration
3. Database setup



4. **Explains how to use the application** with step-by-step instructions for:

1. Generating flash cards
2. Studying with spaced repetition



5. **Documents the project structure** to help developers understand the codebase
6. **Includes placeholder sections for screenshots** (you can replace these with actual screenshots)
7. **Explains the spaced repetition algorithm** used in the application
8. **Provides guidelines for contributions** and licensing information


You can customize this README further by:

- Adding actual screenshots of your application
- Updating the repository URL
- Adding specific deployment instructions
- Including any additional features or customizations you implement


Would you like me to expand on any particular section of the README?

I've updated the README.md with more detailed instructions for building and running the application locally. The new sections include:

### Enhanced Local Development Setup

- More detailed step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment
- Clear commands for installation and running the development server


### Added Production Build Instructions

- Commands for creating an optimized production build
- Instructions for testing the production build locally before deployment


### Expanded Database Setup

- More detailed steps for setting up the Supabase database
- Added command-line option for executing the SQL script using the Supabase CLI


### Added Testing Instructions

- Commands for running the test suite
- Option for continuous testing during development


These additions make the README more comprehensive and helpful for developers who want to build and run the project locally. The instructions cover both development and production environments, ensuring that users can properly set up and test the application before deployment.

Would you like me to add any other specific details to the local build instructions?
