Based on your requirements, I'll create a clean, functional AI Flash Card Generator PoC called "Fiszki" that focuses only on the core functionality: text input → AI generation → display cards. This will be a minimal viable product demonstrating the key concept without any of the out-of-scope features.

Core Features:

Text input form with character count and validation (1000-10000 chars)
Integration with Openrouter.ai API for flash card generation
Display of generated flash cards in a clean, organized list view
Error handling for API failures and validation errors
Loading states and user feedback during processing
Responsive design that works across devices
Design Elements:

Clean, education-focused color scheme with primary blue (#3B82F6), secondary teal (#0EA5E9), and neutral tones
Card-based UI with subtle shadows and animations for flipping cards
Typography system with 2-3 font weights optimized for readability
Consistent 8px spacing system for proper visual rhythm
Animated loading states and transitions for better user experience
Responsive layout adapting to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Project Setup and UI Components (1-2 days)
Set up project structure and organize files
Create the main page layout and navigation
Implement the text input form with validation
Build the flash card display components
Add loading and error states
Phase 2: API Integration (1-2 days)
Set up Openrouter.ai API integration
Implement the card generation service
Connect the form to the API
Handle API responses and errors
Phase 3: Refinement and Testing (1 day)
Polish UI interactions and animations
Ensure responsive design across all devices
Add comprehensive error handling
Test the full user flow
Documentation and code cleanup
Would you like me to proceed with implementing this plan? I'll wait for your explicit approval before writing any code.
